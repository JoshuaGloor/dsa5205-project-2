## Setup

Make sure you have the following installed:

* miniconda

### Python Environment Setup and Jupyter Kernel

If you have a Bash compatible shell, you can set up everything automatically using the provided script:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

If you prefer or need to do the steps manually, the commands annotated in the script under `[manual]` are reproduced here.

#### 1. Create the conda environment manually

From the project root, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

#### 2. Activate the environment

Once created, activate it:

```bash
conda activate p2
```

#### 3. Register the Jupyter kernel manually

With the environment activated, install the kernel:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=p2 --display-name "Python (p2)"
```

This command makes the environment available as a selectable kernel inside Jupyter.

After this, the environment should be ready for use with Jupyter notebooks and the rest of the project.

## Running the Code

After you followed the setup steps and have the environment activated and ready with the kernel installed, you can start the Jupyter server using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, you can open the notebook `assignment_2_code.ipynb` in Jupyter and select the `Python (p2)` kernel to run it.
Alternatively, you can also run the notebook in your favourite IDE.
